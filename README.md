# ClickHouse Agent Skills

The official Agent Skills for [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com/). These skills help LLMs and agents to adopt best practices when working with ClickHouse.

You can use these skills with open-source ClickHouse and managed ClickHouse Cloud. [Try ClickHouse Cloud with $300 in free credits](https://clickhouse.com/cloud?utm_medium=github&utm_source=github&utm_ref=agent-skills).

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add clickhouse/agent-skills
```

The CLI auto-detects installed agents and prompts you to select where to install.

## What is this?

Agent Skills are packaged instructions that extend AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) with domain-specific expertise. This repository provides skills for ClickHouse databases—covering schema design, query optimization, and data ingestion patterns.

When an agent loads these skills, it gains knowledge of ClickHouse best practices and can apply them while helping you design tables, write queries, or troubleshoot performance issues.

Skills follow the open specification at [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io).

## Available Skills

### ClickHouse Best Practices

**28 rules** covering schema design, query optimization, and data ingestion—prioritized by impact.

**For humans:** Read [SKILL.md](./skills/clickhouse-best-practices/SKILL.md) for an overview, or [AGENTS.md](./skills/clickhouse-best-practices/AGENTS.md) for the complete compiled guide.

**For agents:** The skill activates automatically when you work with ClickHouse—creating tables, writing queries, or designing data pipelines.

## Quick Start

After installation, your AI agent will reference these best practices when:

- Creating new tables with `CREATE TABLE`
- Choosing `ORDER BY` / `PRIMARY KEY` columns
- Selecting data types for columns
- Optimizing slow queries
- Writing or tuning JOINs
- Designing data ingestion pipelines
- Handling updates or deletes

Example prompt:
> "Create a table for storing user events with fields for user_id, event_type, properties (JSON), and timestamp"

The agent will apply relevant rules like proper column ordering in the primary key, appropriate data types, and partitioning strategy.

## Supported Agents

Skills are **agent-agnostic**—the same skill works across all supported AI coding assistants:

| Agent | Config Directory |
|-------|------------------|
| [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) | `.claude/skills/` |
| [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) | `.cursor/skills/` |
| [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf) | `.windsurf/skills/` |
| [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) | `.github/skills/` |
| [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | `.gemini/skills/` |
| [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) | `.cline/skills/` |
| [Codex](https://openai.com/codex) | `.codex/skills/` |
| [Goose](https://github.com/block/goose) | `.goose/skills/` |
| [Roo Code](https://roo.ai) | `.roo/skills/` |
| [OpenHands](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands) | `.openhands/skills/` |

And 13 more including Amp, Kiro CLI, Trae, Zencoder, and others.

The installer detects which agents you have by checking for their configuration directories. If an agent isn't listed, either install it first or create its config directory manually (e.g., `mkdir -p ~/.cursor`).
